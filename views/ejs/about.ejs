                <p>
                    Pulse-Post is a dynamic blog web application designed to allow users to engage with blog 
                    content interactively. Built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, it serves as a platform for 
                    learning and showcasing full-stack development skills. This version focuses on core functionalities 
                    like post creation, viewing, editing, and deletion, with a keen eye on responsive and user-friendly 
                    design.

                <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    As an aspiring full-stack developer, creating Pulse-Post has been a significant step in my journey. 
                    I've learned about server-side programming, templating with EJS, and the importance of responsive 
                    design. Tackling challenges such as implementing CRUD operations without a database has sharpened 
                    my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of web application architecture.
                </p>
                    
                <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I plan to expand Pulse-Postâ€™s capabilities. Planned enhancements include adding a 
                    database for data persistence, integrating user authentication for personalized experiences, and 
                    perhaps developing a RESTful API to allow for more flexible data handling.
