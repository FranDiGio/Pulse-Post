                Pulse-Post is a dynamic blog web application designed to allow users to engage with blog 
                content interactively. Built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, it serves as a platform for 
                learning and showcasing full-stack development skills. This version focuses on core functionalities 
                like post creation, viewing, editing, and deletion, with a keen eye on responsive and user-friendly 
                design.

            <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                As an aspiring full-stack developer, creating Pulse-Post has been a significant step in my journey. 
                I've learned about server-side programming, templating with EJS, and the importance of responsive 
                design. Tackling challenges such as implementing CRUD operations without a database has sharpened 
                my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of web application architecture.

            <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I plan to expand Pulse-Post's capabilities. Planned enhancements include adding a 
                database for data persistence, integrating user authentication for personalized experiences, and 
                perhaps developing a RESTful API to allow for more flexible data handling.
